## Homework #4 - GGPlotting

-   The tidyverse library has been loaded in, and the messages are silenced

-   I created a fake data set about 30 cats, I ran the csv file to make sure the data would load into the document accurately and I assigned my csv file to an object for easy reference

-   Then I plotted a line graph of the Age vs Weight of all 30 cats. While the line graph is accurate in plotting this data, a scatter plot would be better for this representation of Age vs Weight.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
read.csv("cats_data_hmw_04.csv")
cats <- read.csv("cats_data_hmw_04.csv")
ggplot(cats) +
  geom_line(aes(x=Age, y=Weight), color="purple")
```
