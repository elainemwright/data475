## Homework #2

Here is the loaded library with the chunk option to hide the text that generates when the library loads into this R session!

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Values are assigned to objects 'a' and 'b' and are then compared

```{r}

a <- 5
b <- 9
a > b
```

The ls functions shows us the objects in the global environment!

```{r}
ls(environment())
```

The rm function clears the global environment/workspace

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
```

The ls function is used again to show that the environment/work space has been cleared successfully!

```{r}
ls(environment())
```
